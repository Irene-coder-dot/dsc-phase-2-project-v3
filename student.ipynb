    "### 1. Box Office Mojo (bom.movie_gross.csv.gz)\n",
    "\n",
    "Provides domestic box office revenue data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Includes key features such as: title, studio, domestic_gross, release_date, and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "used to determine the financial performance of films.\n",

    " ### 2. IMDb(Internet Movie Database) (im.db.zip)\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains detailed metadata about films and user-ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key tables used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* movie_basics: Includes primary_title, original_title, genres, runtime_minutes, and start_year.\n",
    "\n",
    "* movie_ratings: Contains user rating data (average_rating, num_votes).\n",
    "\n",
    "used for movie characteristics and audience quality perceptions.\n",

    " ### 3. TheMovieDB (TMDb) (tmdb.movies.csv.gz)\n",

    "Popularity metrics: Show which films gain audience traction pre- and post-release\n",
    "\n",
    "Vote data: Allows cross-comparison with IMDb ratings\n",
    "\n",

    "* Release_date, movie, production_budget, domestic_gross, worldwide_gross\n",
    "\n",
    "Why It Matters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gives a complete financial picture by providing both the cost of making the film (production budget) and revenue generated globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Allows calculation of Return on Investment (ROI) — one of the most important metrics when deciding which types of films to produce.\n"
